**Today's Progress**: I was having an issue with the font size in nested lists. I was using `em` to size my `ol` and `ul` elements and that was causing my nested lists to have bigger and bigger font sizes. I am pretty new to using `em` so I was really confused until I found [this thread[(https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43439190/different-font-sizes-in-nested-html-list)] over at Stack Overflow. After reading that, I changed my font size to `rem` and it's now working perfectly. Deciding I needed to learn more about `em` and `rem` elements, I watched a pretty good video by Traversy Media. Check it out.

**Thoughts**: I need to do some experimenting with `rem` and `em` to get a better handle on their usage. I'm thinking of redoing all sizing elements in my site to `rem` or `em` just so I can really get a feel for how to use them.
