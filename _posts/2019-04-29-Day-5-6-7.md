**Today's Progress**: For the last three days I have been working through some of the FreeCodeCamp curriculum. I completed the Basic CSS sections that had been added since I last took the course and have worked my way through about half of the Applied Visual Design section.

**Thoughts**: It's been nearly 3 years since I worked on the FreeCodeCamp curriculum and a lot of topics have been added. It's good to work through those new topics and get caught up.
