**Today's Progress**: Played around with Hugo for a bit and created a site on my local computer. Wasn't able to get the template I'd chosen to work correctly and wasn't able to figure out why yet. I am brand new to Hugo so I will probably need to look through the documentation a bit more and perhaps watch some videos. 

I worked on a landing page for this website but then decided I didn't really like it and scraped it and made a Projects page instead. 

**Thoughts**: I think eventually I would like to learn Hugo but it's probably best if I focus on one platform at a time. Since I am already familiar with Jekyll and have made two sites using it, I think I will stick with it for right now. I'd really like to try and make a theme for Jekyll at some point.
