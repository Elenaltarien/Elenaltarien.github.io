Today I am recommiting to the [#100DaysOfCode](https://www.100daysofcode.com/) challenge. I've started this before but then life got busy and unfortunately I didn't keep up with it like I should. But you know what they say, if as first you don't succeed, try again! So here I am giving it another go. 

The official rules for the challege state to code for a minumum of 1 hour a day. I'm going to adjust that a bit and commit to 30 min a day. I have a lot going on right now and want to be sure to set myself up for success. Hopefully, I'll be able to increase that time once things settle down a bit in my day job. 

**My Rules:** 
 1. Code for a minimum of 30 minutes every day. 
 2. Document my progress every day on this blog.
 3. Tweet blog post every day with hashtag #100DaysOfCode and #100DaysOfX.
 4. Daily connect with and encourage at least two other people doing the challenge.
