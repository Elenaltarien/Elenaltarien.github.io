**Today's Progress**: Added margins and padding to my post images on my Zombie Potato blog. Styled ol and ul on this site (Rachel M Fisher). Cleaned up some folder structure on both sites. 

**Thoughts**: Since it's been so long since I really worked on my coding I had to look up a lot of things I used to know right off the top of my head. Just goes to show that I really need to stick with it and practice! But also, it's good to know how to find the information you need.
