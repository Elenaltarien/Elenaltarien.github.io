**Today's Progress**: Moved this site from GitHub pages to Netlify hosting. Moved kinda slow today due to migraine earlier.

**Thoughts**: I like Netlify. I'm going to move all of my sites there. If you have a github pages Jekyll blog that you'd like to move over to Netlify, it's easy to follow their guide. Only thing of note is that their ruby version in the guide seems to be outdated. I had to use 2.6.2 for the build to work.
